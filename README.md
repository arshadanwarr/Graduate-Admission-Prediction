# Graduate-Admission-Prediction
This project aims to predict the chances of admission for graduate students based on their academic and test scores using an ANN. The model is trained on a dataset containing various parameters such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research Experience to estimate the probability of admission.
